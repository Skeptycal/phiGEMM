Last update: Dec 9, 2011

0) Suspected bugs/problems:
  
1) Organization:
  1.0 Configure and makefile

2) Documentation:
  2.0 Write a user guide (compiling & linking)

4) Development:
  4.0  Major highly desirable restructuring:
    4.0.1 Determine the split factor defined at runtime
    4.0.2 Ensure backward compatibility with CUDA 3.x
    4.0.3 Padding the leading dimensions
    4.0.4 Benchmarking which padding is the best (32 like MAGMA?)
    4.0.5 Link to non-MKL multi-threaded BLAS libraries
        
  4.1  New developments to be added (sooner or later):
    4.1.1 Developer a "tuner" program to detect and define 
    4.1.2 extend the FORTRAN90 module to cover all the auxiliary routines
    4.1.3 batched-DGEMM for rectangular matrices
    
  4.2 Small new developments, desirable or to be added:
    4.2.1 Script that easily process the output of the test-suites 
          and produce statistics (Python)
    4.2.2 Add a parallel test case (Cannon algorithm?)
    4.2.3 Manage "ADD_" and no-"ADD_" cases
    
4.3 Performance enhancements:
    4.3.1 Auto-tune the split factor by benchmarking a predefined subset of 
          dimension ranges (ATLAS style -> make ; make test ; make)
      
4.4 Cleanup:
  4.4.1 Remove dead lines of code
 
4.5 Trouble-makers, inconsistencies, etc:
  4.5.1 Verify GNU compiler + Intel MKL linking
