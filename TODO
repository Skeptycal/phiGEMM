0) Suspected bugs/problems:
  
1) Organization:
  1.0 Configure and makefile

2) Documentation:
  2.0 Write a user guide (compiling & linking)

4) Development:
  4.0  Major highly desirable restructuring:
    4.0.2 Padding the leading dimensions
    4.0.3 Benchmarking which padding is the best (32 like MAGMA?)
    4.0.4 Link to non-MKL multi-threaded BLAS libraries (using dlopen)
        
  4.1  New developments to be added (sooner or later):
    4.1.1 Developer a "tuner" program to detect and define 
    
  4.2 Small new developments, desirable or to be added:
    4.2.1 Script that easily process the output of the test-suites 
          and produce statistics (Python)
    4.2.2 Add a parallel test case (Cannon algorithm?)
    4.2.3 Manage "ADD_" and no-"ADD_" cases
    4.2.4 Support to MAGMABLAS instead of CUBLAS
    
4.3 Performance enhancements:
    4.3.1 Auto-tune the split factor by benchmarking a predefined subset of 
          dimension ranges (ATLAS style -> make ; make test ; make)
    4.3.2 Refine heuristic dynamic split factor
    4.3.3 Discover a reliable threshold below that only the CPU have to work
    4.3.4 DAXPY one thread, OpenMP on the external loop (for MKL only)
      
4.4 Cleanup:
  4.4.1 Remove dead lines of code
 
4.5 Trouble-makers, inconsistencies, etc:
  4.5.1 Verify PGI compiler + MPI on several platform
