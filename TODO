0) Suspected bugs/problems:
  
1) Organization:
  1.0 Configure and makefile

2) Documentation:
  2.0 Write a user guide (compiling & linking)

4) Development:
  4.0  Major highly desirable restructuring:
    4.0.1 Determine the split factor defined at runtime
    4.0.2 Ensure backward compatibility with CUDA 3.x
    4.0.3 Initialization of some "global" variable only during the init phase
    
  4.1  New developments to be added (sooner or later):
    4.1.1 Developer a "tuner" program to detect and define 
    4.1.2 Fall-back strategy if the pinned allocation fails (requested too much
          than the allowed by the O.S.)
    
  4.2 Small new developments, desirable or to be added:
    4.2.1 Script that easily process the output of the test-suites 
          and produce statistics (Python)
    4.2.2 Restore MAGMA interface
    4.2.3 Add a parallel test case (Cannon algorithm?)
    
4.3 Performance enhancements:
  4.3 split factor not for S/D/Z but for {NN,NT,TN,TT} cases
  
4.4 Cleanup:
  4.4.1 Remove dead lines of code
  4.4.2 Remove not used macro
 
4.5 Trouble-makers. inconsistencies, etc:
