Note from the project maintainer
--------------------------------

I do not earn a salary for my work on phiGEMM which is pro bono and performed
during my spare time. If you have benefited from this project or you are simply
interested to leave a feedback, please consider to get in contact with me by 
email. Since CUDA 6.0 NVBLAS covers most of the concept address by phiGEMM.
